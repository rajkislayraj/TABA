Its length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit.

70,The car is good on cosmetics but I don't think that you can trust the engine for the long run. MG still needs to take care and refine the engine according to Indian road conditions.
